## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Connor Rideout. I'm a software engineer who is passionate about solving puzzles, maintaining readability, and truly understanding _why_ things work the way they do.
- I'm currently working through the Full-Stack Developer bootcamp with BloomTech
- I've taught myself Python and have been using it for 5+ years
- Before programming became my passion, I worked in leadership positions during my retail career for more than 8 years
